# SpotifyInsights

SpotifyInsights allows users to view changes over time in the demographics of a Spotify account's liked songs.

CSE 143 final project by Mitchell Levy, Jaden Wang, and Lianne Kniest (2020).

## Description

One's music habits are uniquely personal and representative of different moods and preferences - how they change over time is something that when looked at provides a chance to get to know a person better (think Spotify Wrapped). We took inspiration from [Spotify Wrapped](https://2020.byspotify.com/) and wanted to bring the deeper access to a user's data that Spotify allows but doesn't make easily accessible.

Our tool aims to show insight on how a user's taste within their liked songs has changed over time and to show their current favorite tracks.
