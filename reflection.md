# Reflection
## What we learned  
Throughout this project, we learned the basics of how to use GitHub and Git. Although this had a really steep learning curve, we all came out of it with more understanding of version control than before. We also learned about how to work with information from the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and we also imported a [JSON parser.](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) It took some time to understand how these would interact with each other and with our HTTPS server, but we eventually were able to figure out the logic to make it work. In general, we learned how to collaborate both with each other and with existing available resources. 

## What we enjoyed  
We were happy that we were able to create an application that works with Spotify since we all use Spotify often. It was nice to produce something that adds some functionality to an existing app that we interact with day to day. We also liked that we were able to learn more about a variety of things as mentioned above. It was very nice being able to explore version control in a low-pressure environment. 

## Challenges and frustrations  
Most of our struggles stemmed from trying to understand how the different components of our project would work together - how would we write classes that handled the data properly while also accurately sending and receiving information from one element to another? There was also a lot of confusion around getting Git and GitHub, but we were able to navigate this together while referencing advice from online resources. 

## Helpful resources  
[This video](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/) gave us a stronger understanding of how to work with Git and GitHub.<br> 
[Spotify's web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), specifically the [API endpoint reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/), was extremely helpful for understanding how to process the JSON data we were receiving.<br> 
The [JSON parser](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) we used, along with its [documentation,](http://stleary.github.io/JSON-java/index.html) were referenced often throughout the development process.<br>
We were also very appreciative of the help we received from TAs through IPL and Ed.
